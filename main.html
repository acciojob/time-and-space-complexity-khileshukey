<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to run, and it is a measure of the efficiency of the algorithm. It is often denoted as O(f(n)), where f(n) represents the growth rate of the algorithm as the input size increases. An algorithm with a lower time complexity is considered more efficient as it takes less time to execute.</p>

<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run, and it is also a measure of the efficiency of the algorithm. It is often denoted as O(n), where n represents the input size. The space complexity of an algorithm determines how much memory it needs to store and manipulate data. Algorithms with a lower space complexity are considered more efficient as they require less memory.</p>
